    <h2>Meet the Frogs</h2>
    <p>Frogs are incredible amphibians that live on every continent except Antarctica. Their
    smooth, moist skin helps them breathe through it.</p>

    <h2>Life Cycle</h2>
    <p>Frogs begin life as eggs in water, hatch into tadpoles, and grow legs as they transform
    into adult frogs. This is called metamorphosis.</p>

    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    <p>Many frogs are nocturnal. They use sticky tongues to catch insects and call loudly to
    attract mates.</p>
