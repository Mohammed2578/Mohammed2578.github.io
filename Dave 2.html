        <h1>Dave is a proud Jewish guy with family roots from both Russia and Ukraine. That means he comes from a background full of rich culture, great food, and very strong opinions about bread.</h1> 
        <h2>He loves his Jewish faith and enjoys celebrating holidays with his family. Whether itâ€™s lighting candles for Hanukkah or asking way too many questions during Passover, Dave keeps traditions alive with a smile </h2>
        <h3>Dave is also very bad at video games often shooting the ball in to his own net. Running in to his own endzone and very often falling off of things. Because of how bad dave is at video games he is usually very angry when playing causing him to put holes in his walls and break controllers </h3>
