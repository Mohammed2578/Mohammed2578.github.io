        <h1>Dave Ashkanazy</h1>

        <p>
            Dave is a proud Jewish guy with family roots from both Russia and Ukraine.
            That means he comes from a background full of rich culture, great food,
            and very strong opinions about bread.
        </p>

        <p>
            He loves his Jewish faith and enjoys celebrating holidays with his family.
            Whether it’s lighting candles for Hanukkah or asking way too many questions during Passover,
            Dave keeps traditions alive with a smile.
        </p>

        <p>
            Dave is also very bad at video games — often shooting the ball into his own net,
            running into his own endzone, and frequently falling off things.
            Because of how bad Dave is at video games, he usually gets very angry while playing,
            sometimes putting holes in walls or breaking controllers.
